# Uselessfacts

Uselessfacts is a mobile application developed using Flutter with Riverpod and Dio. It leverages a [free API](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) to fetch random useless facts.

The app features a black-and-white color scheme that creates a reflective atmosphere, complemented by smooth animations and soothing background music. In the future, there are plans to develop a custom backend in Dart, transforming this project into a full-stack application and adding more intriguing facts on various topics that inspire contemplation about life.
